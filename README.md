# 💻 Rust Software Engineer | From Frontend to Systems | Sharing Rust, Backend & WASM dev journey 🚀
## 👋 About Me  

Hi, I’m Issa Soliu — a Rust Software Engineer passionate about building high-performance systems, reliable backends, and next-gen WebAssembly applications.

🦀 Skilled in Rust (ownership, async, systems programming), with hands-on experience using Tokio, Axum, Serde, and WASM.
💻 Former Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript — now merging that experience with Rust for full-stack power.
⚡ I craft solutions that are safe, scalable, and blazing fast, from command-line tools to distributed backends and WebAssembly-powered apps.
📚 Always exploring systems programming, concurrency, and modern backend architecture.
🤝 Open to Rust engineering roles, OSS collaboration, and freelance opportunities worldwide.
